# Simulation-Ants-vs-Spiders
A simulation made in C++ using SFML Library.
In this Simulation are Ants and Spiders, they are fighting.
Spiders have its own ability - if gets attacked by an ant, then they produce a radiation which damages the ant or ants slowly.
The radiation can damage multiple or more ants.
Ants attack spiders by eating them, basically decreasing their health until they die.
One ant can attack only one spider. But for example, like 10 ants can even attack one spider, but spiders radiation will
damage the 10 ants.
